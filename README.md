# 🚚 StockFlow – Inventory Optimization with Demand Forecasting

## 🎯 Objective  
Optimize inventory levels using demand forecasting and cost modeling to minimize stockouts and reduce holding costs.

## 🧪 Business Context  
Retailers face a constant tradeoff: ordering too much leads to excess inventory, while ordering too little causes stockouts. Inventory optimization helps balance cost and service levels.

## 🧠 Workflow  
- Simulate weekly demand  
- Forecast future demand using moving averages  
- Calculate EOQ and reorder points  
- Model holding and ordering costs  
- Visualize inventory strategy  
- Recommend optimal order frequency

## 📊 Key Insights  
- EOQ = 1,032 units  
- Forecasting supports proactive inventory planning  
- Strategic ordering reduces cost and improves service levels
